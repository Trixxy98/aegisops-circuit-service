# circuit-service

AegisOps target service. `GET /health` and `GET /version` are required. CI registers artifacts in the `circuit-service` project and requests a Staging deployment.

`demo/vulnerable` is a demo branch and is never merged. It contains a fake AWS example key, a SQL string concatenation endpoint, an MD5 hash, and an old runtime image so Gitleaks, Semgrep, and Trivy each produce findings.
